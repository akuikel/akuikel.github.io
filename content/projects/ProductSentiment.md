An advanced NLP sentiment analysis system that predicts product review ratings (1-5 stars) using deep learning techniques. Built with PyTorch and FastAI, the project employs a two-stage approach: first training a language model for next-word prediction on Amazon reviews, then fine-tuning it for multi-class sentiment classification. Features transfer learning implementation, comprehensive text preprocessing, and handles the complexity of nuanced sentiment variations in real-world review data, achieving meaningful predictions despite the inherent subjectivity in human rating patterns.
