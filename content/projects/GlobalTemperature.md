A machine learning project that predicts global temperature changes for the next decade using deep learning techniques. Built with Python and TensorFlow, the model utilizes a 3-layer LSTM neural network trained on 116 years of historical temperature data (1880-2020) to forecast climate trends. Features comprehensive data preprocessing, time series analysis, model evaluation using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared metrics, and generates actionable insights for climate impact assessment and environmental policy planning.
